    <summary><b>The Automation Process:</b> \U0001F448</summary>\n\n\n  - **Trigger:**\n
    \   - You can choose any [binary sensors](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/binary_sensor/)
    or [schedules](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/schedule) to trigger
    the automation.\n    - A trigger sensor, such as a Motion Sensor, will activate
    lights, switches, scenes, and scripts when the automation is triggered.\n    -
    A time delay begins the turning OFF process after all triggers are clear. See
    [grouping](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/481048/34) sensors for more information.\n
    \   - If triggers are activated again before the time delay ends, the automation
    resets for continuous lighting.\n\n  - **Scene and Script Integration:**\n    -
    Scenes or scripts offer additional customization for your spaces.\n\n  - **Light
    Control Options:**\n      - Utilize \"Light Control\" to adjust brightness, colour
    temperature, colour, and transition times.\n\n  - **Dynamic Lighting Options:**\n
    \   - Opt for 'Dynamic Lighting' to continuously adjust brightness based on lux
    values or adapt colour temperature and brightness according to the sun's changing
    elevation.\n\n  - **Manual Override:**\n    - Use \"Bypass Options\" for manual
    bypassing of trigger sensors, providing manual control and additional customization.\n\n
    \ - **Sun Elevation Options:**\n    - Implement \"Sun Elevation\" to restrict
    automation to darker conditions aligned with the sun's position.\n\n  - **Ambient
    Light Sensing Options:**\n    - Set up an Ambient Light Sensor for activation
    in low-light conditions, customizable with specified LUX values.\n\n  - **Time-Based
    Options:**\n    - Specify precise start and end times along with weekday selections
    to define when the automation should run.\n\n  - **Device Tracker Options:**\n
    \   - Utilize \"Device Tracker\" to activate automation when home or within specified
    zones, preventing unnecessary activations. This feature is particularly useful
    to prevent unnecessary lighting activations when pets trigger sensors while no
    one is home.\n\n  - **Night Lights Mode:**\n    - Enable \"Night Lights\" for
    softer illumination during night time activities, automatically enabled based
    on conditions.\n\n  - **HA Restart Safeguards:**\n    - Benefit from built-in
    safeguards for Home Assistant restarts.\n\n  - **Blueprint Add-On Integration:**\n

            you can also add a [schedule helper](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/481048/1616).


            When using multiple trigger sensors, it''s advisable to group them together
            using a group helper. This ensures smoother automation execution and prevents
            conflicts.
